The analysis involved downloading a data set obtained from an experiment with 30 participants within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each participant performed six activities (walking, waling-upstairs, walking-downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) while wearing the Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist.

The dataset contained two major folders namely the test and train data sets. The test data folder contained the signal recorded from the three axis of smartphone (x, y and z) and the resulting data was processed using a series of algorithms to obtain the variables for the analysis. The same process was used for data contained in the training folder.

The folder also contained information on the features, features info and activity lables.
